## Qdo GoTrue API

This is a rust implementation of [GoTrueApi](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/blob/0cb0b12155969e2f2ba4fb8cadb1d23b92844195/src/GoTrueApi.ts#L300) library, not GoTrue Client, for my qdo application.

GoTrueAPI is just a wrapper of sevral authentication methods provided by supabase to access its database. You can see what authentication endpoints provided [here](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue#endpoints).
